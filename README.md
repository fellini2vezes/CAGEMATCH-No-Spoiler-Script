This is a script that hides the information about the winners of each match in the tabs with the most information, specifically in 'matches', 'advanced search', 'tournaments' or when searching through wrestlers, tag teams, or stables.
cagematch.com

The first thing implemented was shuffling the wrestlers or tag teams in the match card multiple times before placing them in the card, which prevent the discovery of the winners based on their positions.
The terms 'and', 'defeat' and 'defeats', have been changed to 'vs.'.
The phrases 'by Count Out', 'by DQ', 'by TKO', 'No Contest', 'TITLE CHANGE!!!', 'xx - match length' and '(c)' have been removed.

The revised version introduced a way to view the hidden result of a specific match. A button called 'show' has been added to the right corner of the match cards, and if you want to hide it again, simply click the button, which will now be labeled 'hide'.
In this revised version, there is also an option to hide a wrestler's qualification in 'Tournaments'. This allows you to see the tournaments in which a specific wrestler participated without revealing the results. As mentioned earlier, the 'show' button is added to view their qualification in that tournament, and if you want to hide it again, just click on the qualification.
Feel free to enjoy the script, and please report any bugs or suggestions below. I will always be reviewing versions and updating them, sometimes just updating the topic, and at other times (with crucial changes) creating a new one and deleting the old one.
